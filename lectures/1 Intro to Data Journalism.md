## "Thinking analytically is a skill like carpentry or driving a car. It can be taught, it can be learned, and it can improve with practice. But like many other skills, such as riding a bike, it is not learned by sitting in a classroom and being told how to do it. Analysts learn by doing." -- Richards J. Heuer, Jr., Psychology of Intelligence Analysis

# What makes data journalism different than regular journalism?

The combination of traditional storytelling and all of the digital information now available?

The possibilities can come at any stage of the journalistâ€™s process:
* using programming to automate the process of gathering and combining information from local government, police, and other civic sources as seen on [SpotCrime](https://spotcrime.com/pa/pittsburgh)
* Or using software to find connections between hundreds of thousands of documents, as The Telegraph did with [MPs' expenses](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/mp-expenses/).
* Visualizing complex data like [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$chart-type=bubbles) does with poverty
* Relating a story to the reader like BBC does with their [financial calculator tools](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-17442946)

# Why is data journalism so important?
* People don't get their news from newspapers
* No need to wait until the paper is delivered
	* But social sharing of news is [crap](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-could-replace-president-trump-with-little_us_5829f25fe4b02b1f5257a6b7)
* Gathering, filtering and visualizing what is happening beyond what the eye can see has a growing value.
* Data = little points of information that are often not relevant in a single instance
	* But massively important when viewed from the right angle.
* Not the first to tell the story
	* You're the one who says what it means and how it applies
* Becoming knowledgeable in searching, cleaning, and visualizing data is transformative for the profession of information gathering 
* Giant survey of European journalists
	* They nearly all agreed that data is important
	* They nearly all also agreed that they aren't given the resources to learn how to do it
