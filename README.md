## Course information

Journalists today are expected to find stories hidden inside complex data. In this class, you will combine your analytical abilities with modern software to look at raw data in new ways. You are not merely summarizing events or information -- this is investigative journalism at its core. This lecture class will employ code, data, basic stats, analytical thinking, and practical journalism techniques.

### Course goal

By the end of this course, you will have a practical understanding of the tools and programming languages required for in-depth analysis of complex data.

### Course objectives

| Upon successful completion of this course, the student should be able to: | Assignment | WU COM Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employ data journalism approaches to investigate an issue at an in-depth level | 1-5 | 2a, 3 |
| Design compelling data visualizations that highlight interesting trends in a selected data pool | 5 | 2a, 3, 5, 6 |
| Write code that allows complex data to be more easily understood | 5 | 2a |

### Learning outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1. Employ data journalism techniques to improve an investigative story
2. Clean data collected from the internet
3. Use appropriate software to analyze data
4. Create unique data visualizations to improve the effectiveness of a journalistic story
5. Use software to plot data onto an electronic map

## Assignments

All assignments are worth 50 points.

### Data collection

Find two data sources: one that’s online and one that is not. You will present to the class about the data’s location, maintenance, and why it’s interesting. Obtaining the offline data source will be a semester-long quest.

### Excel data cleaning

Use Excel commands and formulas to clean up and transform data. Apply learned strategies and tricks for managing your data cleaning processes.

### DataWrangler and INZight

Use DataWrangler to transform data in wide format into long (or “tidy”) format. Use INZight to make basic discoveries in your data.

### Visualization

You will make your first data story pitch. The pitch must include a link to the data you will use, and an explanation of what is going on and why we should care. You must also include the name of one source you have already spoken with, or three sources you plan to speak with. These sources should be experts who can explain or contextualize your data.

### Mapping

You will submit your first story draft. This must be a complete story. You should have completed all reporting, all data cleaning, and all visualizations. Don’t forget details such as legends, source links and photo credits, as well as a good headline. You must talk to at least one human source who can explain or contextualize the data. You don’t have to quote them in the story, but you do have to be able to tell the class what you learned from talking to the source.

### RawGraphs

Use RawGraphs to create an appropriate data visualization. You will locate the data, clean it, use RawGraph to create the visualization, and output it to Illustrator for final editing.

### D3

Use D3 to create an appropriate data visualization with interactivity. You will locate the data, clean it, and use D3 to create the final visualization.

### Scraping

Use web scraping software to collect difficult data from the web. You will need to locate the source of data and create a custom matching pattern for the scraping software.

### Tableau
Use Tableau to generate an appropriate data visualization. You will locate the data, clean it, and use Tableau to create the final visualization.

### R

Use R to create an appropriate data visualization. This assignment is heavy on coding. You will use R to output a basic data visualuzation.

## Course policies

There are a lot of them. I won't post them here to save people that are forking this repository. If you are a WU student, you can [view them here](COURSE-POLICIES.md).
