## Attendance & late policy

You are expected to attend every class. Your presence and active discussion at all course meetings is at the heart of a meaningful class experience. More than 3 absences will result in an automatic grade reduction.

| Number of absences | Penalty             |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 4                  | 33 point deduction  |
| 5                  | 100 point deduction |
| 6+                 | 200 point deduction |

If you must miss a class because of a college-sanctioned activity, you must notify me in advance of the class and make all necessary arrangements. If you miss class for serious medical problems, or other extenuating circumstances resulting in your being absent from class for an extended period of time, you should contact the Office of Academic Affairs in addition to notifying me. 

## Academic integrity

The principles of truth and honesty are recognized as fundamental to any community of teachers and scholars. The University has a responsibility for maintaining academic integrity to protect the quality of education, research, and co-curricular activities on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity.

In this course, I exercise great care when planning your assignments, so that honest effort will be positively encouraged. It is your responsibility of to refrain from academic dishonesty and from conduct which aids others in academic dishonesty. This responsibility means that all academic work will be done by you without unauthorized aid of any kind. 

If any instance of academic dishonesty is discovered, I will notify you in writing so that we can discuss the proposed sanction. If you are found guilty of cheating or plagiarism, you will receive an “F” for the exam or assignment. A repeat incident of academic dishonesty in any form will result in failure of the course.

Please read the material in your Waynesburg University Academic Catalog that states the entire Waynesburg University Academic Integrity Policy (pg. 60 2016-2017 Waynesburg University Academic Catalog).
