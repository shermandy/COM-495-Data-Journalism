## Attendance & late policy

You are expected to attend every class. Your presence and active discussion at all course meetings is at the heart of a meaningful class experience. More than 3 absences will result in an automatic grade reduction.

| Number of absences | Penalty             |
| ------------------ | ------------------- |
| 4                  | 33 point deduction  |
| 5                  | 100 point deduction |
| 6+                 | 200 point deduction |

If you must miss a class because of a college-sanctioned activity, you must notify me in advance of the class and make all necessary arrangements. If you miss class for serious medical problems, or other extenuating circumstances resulting in your being absent from class for an extended period of time, you should contact the Office of Academic Affairs in addition to notifying me. 

## Academic integrity

The principles of truth and honesty are recognized as fundamental to any community of teachers and scholars. The University has a responsibility for maintaining academic integrity to protect the quality of education, research, and co-curricular activities on our campus and to protect those who depend upon our integrity.

In this course, I exercise great care when planning your assignments, so that honest effort will be positively encouraged. It is your responsibility of to refrain from academic dishonesty and from conduct which aids others in academic dishonesty. This responsibility means that all academic work will be done by you without unauthorized aid of any kind. 

If any instance of academic dishonesty is discovered, I will notify you in writing so that we can discuss the proposed sanction. If you are found guilty of cheating or plagiarism, you will receive an “F” for the exam or assignment. A repeat incident of academic dishonesty in any form will result in failure of the course.

Please read the material in your Waynesburg University Academic Catalog that states the entire Waynesburg University Academic Integrity Policy (pg. 60 2016-2017 Waynesburg University Academic Catalog).

## Code of conduct

Please note that all provisions of the Code of Conduct will apply in this course. Students who violate the Code of Conduct will be reported for disciplinary action. 

## Disability services/accommodations

Waynesburg University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities to students with documented disabilities (e.g. mental health, learning, chronic health, etc.) through reasonable accommodations. To inquire about accommodations, please contact Courtney Balban (cbalban@waynesburg.edu) in the Disability Services Office as soon as possible, in order to engage in a confidential conversation about the process. 

### Make-up & late work

In an effort to be fair to all students in the course, late work will not be accepted. Assignments are due on the date assigned at the beginning of the class. Assignments will be considered late after that time. Regardless of whether you are in class or not, you are expected to submit all work by the assigned due date. Absence from class does not excuse you from handing in assignments on time. If you know you will be unable to attend a class, notify me in advance and make arrangements to complete the assignments on time.

If you are absent, you must take responsibility for making sure you have the class notes, handouts, and assignments. If you know that you will be unable to attend a class to take an exam on time, you are responsible to make the necessary arrangements with me to take the exam prior to the scheduled date. The exam must be made up before the next class meeting. If no arrangements are made, the student will receive a zero for the exam. 

### Inclement weather

If we miss class due to inclement weather, or any emergency situation, do not assume we will cover only the material scheduled for that day at the next meeting. Continue to read ahead and be prepared for the next meeting’s assignments as well. Any assignments or tests due on a missed day will occur at the next class meeting. If the missed day is prior to the test/assignment, be prepared to go on as scheduled.

### Technology etiquette

Smartphones and other communication technologies can be very disruptive to the academic process. All media (smartphones, headphones, etc.) are to be turned off and placed out of sight while class is in session. Students caught checking their phones, texting, surfing the Internet, or using other media during class will be counted as absent. Students caught on their phones or using other media during an exam or any graded exercise will be cited for academic dishonesty and will be asked to immediately leave the class.

### Online course evaluation process

You are expected to provide feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing an online course evaluation at the end of the semester. Evaluations are open during the final two weeks of the semester and you will be alerted via e-mail when they are available.
